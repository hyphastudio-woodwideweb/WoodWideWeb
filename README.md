# WOODWIDEWEB

Forget the reality you are familiar with, because there is a hidden life connection beneath your feet. Nature speaks a language even
more complex than ours. The mycelium is the oldest form of connection, the underground brain of the earth, a system of
collaboration that verges on perfection. This magical realm is also called the Wood Wide Web, where decay and renewal occur and
everything lives in and for the community. Without the fungal world, Nature would not survive, since the mycelium is able to transport
all kinds of information through its hyphae. Nutritional, energy, danger and protection data are transported even kilometres away from
where the fungus of origin is settled.

Wood Wide Web inspires you to detach yourself from everything you know and get in touch with what you belong to: the Earth. Raise with
us a new way of living by joining the Fungi-centrism.

# Hypha Studio

Hypha Studio is a scientific studio based at 45° 30' 19.000" N 9° 10' 03.000" E founded in 2022. It consists of a merge of researchers, scientists, and specialized mycologists united by the goal of finding new ecological, yet avant-garde means of communication. Indeed, their aim is to popularize mushroom knowledge and change the ethical-moral thinking brought by the anthropocentric philosophy now ingrained in modern man.
Hypha Studio launched the ambitious "Wood Wide Web" project. It consists on the study of the fungal underground communications that are being transmitted every second under our feet and that are the supporting pillar for the life of our ecosystem.
Plants are talking to each other and the fungus is the medium, the justifier, the king that rules over these communications and data transmissions. The project is to bring this very ancient and primordial communication to the benefit of humans, but without falling into the error of destroying the biodiversity that was able to create the mycelium.
The machinery will be made available to everyone and will allow for the first time in history to connect a human being to an organic creature through the very connection with the fungus. In the future there will be multiple locations from which users who want to access the device will be able to enter it from multiple different points around the world to connect with the soil. Hypha's aim is leading humans to be more aware of what is happening around and with them.

Hypha Studio's diverse body of work integrates new technologies with traditional mediums such as sculpture, performance and site-specific installation. Drawing on sources ranging from ancient philosophy to theoretical science, the practice explores the cultural frameworks and natural phenomena that shape our cognition, creating tools that manipulate our perception and expose the relativity of our experiences. Rather than material objects, Hypha's works are best understood as events in time, in which the performance of light, sound and movement unfolds.
